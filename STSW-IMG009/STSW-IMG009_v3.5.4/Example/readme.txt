@par VL53L1X Expansion Board example Description

This directory contains reference project that demonstrates the functionalities of
STMicroelectronics X-NUCLEO-53L1A1 Expansion Board. The demo
application runs on STM32F4xx-Nucleo and STM32L4xx-Nucleo boards.

@par Hardware and Software environment
    
  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM32F401RE and STM32L476RG Nucleo boards

  - This example requires a X-NUCLEO-53L1A1 expansion board

@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Open your preferred toolchain (IAR, Keil, STM32Workbench)
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Open an Tera Term session
 - Select the right COM port
 - Reset Nucleo board
 - Observe the distance measured on the Tera Term.
